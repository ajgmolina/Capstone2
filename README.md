## Mortgage Loan Applications in the USA (2018-2019): Will your application be approved?
by Andrés García Molina

The ability to procure a mortgage loan conditions the quality of life of millions of people worldwide. What are the factors that contribute to a loan application being accepted or rejected? This project implements machine learning models on millions of observations from mortgage applications in the United States in order to determine which are the most important predictors of loan application outcomes.

Starting in 2007, the US government's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has provided yearly data pertaining to all mortgage applications across the country, responding to HMDA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act) regulations which make mortgage-loan data public in order to assess discriminatory patterns and assist public officials in targeting public investment. Data from 2018 and 2019 is analyzed.

This project includes the following steps:

I.   Data Wrangling
II.  Exploratory Data Analysis
III. Feature Engineering
IV.  Modeling
